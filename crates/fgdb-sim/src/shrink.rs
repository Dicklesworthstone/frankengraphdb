//!
//! # The one law, and why it is a type and not a string comparison
//!
//! A shrinker searches for a smaller input that "still fails". Taken literally
//! that is wrong, and wrong in a way that is very hard to see afterwards: a
//! plan that loses acknowledged bytes can be minimised into one that merely
//! runs out of space, and the filed reproducer then describes a different bug
//! than the one that was found. The reduction looks like a success — it is
//! smaller, and it is red.
//!
//! So [`shrink`] accepts a candidate only when it fails with the **same
//! [`FailureKind`]** as the original. The kind is carried on
//! [`Failure`] as a value precisely so this check cannot degrade into matching
//! on a message whose text contains a byte count.
//!
//! # What "smaller" means here
//!
//! The search space is the [`FaultPlan`], and the ordering is by *blame*: a
//! reproducer is better when it accuses fewer things. In descending order of
//! what a reader has to rule out:
//!
//! 1. **fault classes** — a plan naming three classes leaves a reader asking
//!    which one did it. Removing a class is the largest single reduction, so
//!    classes are dropped first, one at a time, greedily.
//! 2. **trigger strength** — `Always` fires on every eligible operation;
//!    `Nth(k)` fires on one in `k`. A reproducer that needs the fault only
//!    once is sharper than one that needs it everywhere.
//! 3. **space budget** — dropped when the failure does not need it.
//!
//! Each step is accepted only if the reduced plan still fails the same way, so
//! the result is *1-minimal*: no single further reduction in this lattice
//! preserves the failure. That is a real and checkable property, and it is
//! weaker than "globally minimal" — which delta debugging does not promise
//! either. Stated rather than implied.
